<h1> BEATBOX-ECE-425-Final-Project</h1>
  
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<hr><p>This repository contains the Keil uVision5 project files for my BEATBOX project, developed for the ECE 425 (Microprocessor Systems)class in Fall 2024. The project features a musical device powered by the TM4C123GXL LaunchPad, integrating a rotary encoder, 16x2 LCD, and a piezo buzzer to deliver customizable sound experiences.

</p><h2>Description</h2>

<hr><ul>
<li>The project utilizes the TM4C123GXL LaunchPad Microcontroller to create an interactive music player system capable of playing 4 different songs. The setup includes a piezo buzzer for audio input, a 16x2 LCD Display for menu navigation and song selection, a rotary encoder for user input, and jumper wires for connectivity. This combination allows users to select and play songs with visual feedback through display.</li>

<li>This project aims to design and build a simple, cost-effective, and interactive music-playing device that can be used for educational purposes or as a prototype for more advanced projects. By incorporating a user-friendly interference through the rotary encoder and LCD, the system allows users to select and play 4 songs, with clear visual feedback on the display. This improves accessibility and usability compared to traditional music systems.</li>

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>Ever since I was young, I have always enjoyed playing Super Mario Bros, which sparked my interest in learning how to display characters on an LCD. My initial plan was to familiarize myself with basic LCD display techniques and eventually move on to a more ambitious projectâ€”a Super Mario Bros game using a different type of LCD display. This is why I decided to include a mini animation for Mario with his theme song playing in the background. Another key motivation for choosing this project was the recent release of a new album by one of my favorite artists. This inspired me to explore the possibility of playing music through a piezo buzzer, combining my love for music with my interest in electronics and programming.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>This project was built upon various tutorials and guides that provided essential knowledge on programming the TM4C123GXL LaunchPad and interfacing with components such as the LCD, rotary encoder, and piezo buzzer. These resources helped me understand the necessary coding techniques and hardware connections required to develop the system.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>I greatly appreciate the clear explanations and step-by-step instructions that made it possible to integrate these components seamlessly. Special thanks to Professor Aaron Nanas and the ECE 425 Microprocessor Systems course for their comprehensive insights and support throughout the development process.</li>
